## One Term Only - Kenya's Youth Political Movement Platform

WANTAM.INK is a decentralized, blockchain-powered political activism platform designed to mobilize Kenyan youth for the 2027 elections. The platform promotes the "One-Term" movement against corruption, backed by the $WANTAM token on Solana.

## 🚀 Mission

Make Kenya a One-Term Country. No Second Chances for Corruption.

WANTAM (derived from "ONE TERM") is a movement ensuring the current regime is not re-elected due to economic mismanagement and corruption. The platform empowers Kenya's youth (projected to be 60% of votes in 2027) to campaign for clean-slate leaders with integrity.

- **County Participation Map**: Visualize movement growth across Kenya's 47 counties
- **$WANTAM Token Integration**: Solana-based token with 1B fixed supply
- **Social Sharing**: Spread the movement on X (Twitter), WhatsApp, and Telegram
- **Dark Mode UI**: Modern, bold design reflecting the movement's energy

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Components**: shadcn/ui, custom UI components
